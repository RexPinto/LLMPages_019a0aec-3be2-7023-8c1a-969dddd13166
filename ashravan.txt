Ashravan awoke with a gasp, the taste of metal and ozone still lingering on his tongue. He sat up, disoriented, the familiar scent of incense and old stone filling his nostrils. The Dakhor monastery, or what remained of it, stood around him, scarred and broken from the Reod. But he was… whole. Shai had done it. She had restored him.

He flexed his fingers, feeling the smooth, unbroken surface of his skin. The scars that had plagued him for decades, the marks of torture and betrayal, were gone. Erased. He felt… lighter. Freer. A smile touched his lips, the first genuine smile he could remember in years.

But the euphoria was fleeting. A flicker of memory, a half-formed image of a hooded figure lurking in the shadows, sent a shiver down his spine. He was not alone.

He rose, his movements cautious, and scanned the courtyard. The other monks were gone, either fled or perished in the chaos. Only silence answered his gaze. Then, a whisper. A voice, thin and reedy, that seemed to slither into his mind.

“You are… restored. But at what cost?”

Ashravan whirled around, his hand instinctively reaching for the non-existent sword at his side. Standing at the edge of the courtyard, bathed in shadow, was a figure cloaked in black. Only the gleam of two crimson eyes betrayed its presence.

“Who are you?” Ashravan demanded, his voice barely a rasp.

The figure chuckled, a dry, rattling sound. “A benefactor, of sorts. I saw your… predicament. And I offered assistance. Through Shai, of course. She is… resourceful.”

“What do you want?”

“Only what is owed. You were broken, Ashravan. And I helped put you back together. Now, you serve me.” The figure raised a hand, and a pulse of dark energy erupted from it, striking Ashravan in the chest. He staggered back, clutching at his heart, a searing pain ripping through him.

“I will not be a puppet!” Ashravan roared, summoning the last vestiges of his strength. He would not succumb. He would not be controlled. But the darkness was relentless, consuming him, twisting him, changing him. He screamed, a sound of pure agony, as the figure’s power took hold, binding him to its will. His restored body, his newfound freedom, meant nothing. He was a prisoner once more.
